        <h1>Portfolio Disclosure</h1>
        <p>Dear Visitors,</p>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you’ll find a collection of my creative work, including personal projects and collaborations with clients. I believe in openness and honesty, so I’d like to clarify a few points:</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Projects:</strong><br>
        Some of the projects showcased here are purely personal endeavors. They represent my passion, experimentation, and growth as a designer/developer.<br>
        These projects are not associated with any specific client or organization.</p>
        <p><strong>Client Work:</strong><br>
        Other projects featured in this portfolio were created for clients. These collaborations allowed me to apply my skills to real-world challenges.<br>
        <strong>Important:</strong> For any client-related work displayed, I have obtained proper consent and approval. Clients are aware that their projects are being showcased here.</p>
        <p><strong>Confidentiality and Respect:</strong><br>
        I respect client confidentiality and adhere to professional ethics.<br>
        If a project is not displayed, it’s because the client requested privacy or the work is under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).</p>
        <p>Thank you for exploring my portfolio. If you have any questions or would like to discuss a specific project, feel free to reach out!</p>
        <p class="signature">Best regards,<br>Damilola.</p>
